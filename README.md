# Product-Management-Project
The Product Management System is a web-based application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) product entries. It is built using Spring Boot, which simplifies the setup and development of Java applications.

# Technical Stack
Backend:
------------------------------------------------------
Spring Boot: For building the RESTful API and managing application configurations.
Spring Data JPA: For database operations using Java Persistence API (JPA).

Database:
MySQL/PostgreSQL: As the relational database management system to store product  data.

# Implementation Steps
Project Setup:
Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA.

# Database Configuration:
Set up the database connection in application.properties 
Create necessary tables for products  in the database.

# Model Creation:
Define entity classes such as Product to represent the data structure.
Use annotations like @Entity, @Table, and @Id for ORM mapping.

# Repository Layer:
Create repository interfaces extending JpaRepository for CRUD operations on the product entities.

# Service Layer:
Implement service classes that contain business logic related to product management.

# Controller Layer:
Develop controllers to handle HTTP requests and map them to appropriate service methods.

# Conclusion
By utilizing modern frameworks like Spring Boot, this project will demonstrate best practices in software development while delivering a functional web application suitable for various business needs.
